### Predicting Housing Prices in Ames, IA


**Goal:** The goal of this project was to reinforce basic EDA and regression model techniques, with emphasis on  cross-validation, feature selection and  engineering and refining models over time. This was done by using the [Ames, IA Housing Data set](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques "Ames Kaggle Competition") and submitting to the Kaggle competition to be scored on unseen data.
